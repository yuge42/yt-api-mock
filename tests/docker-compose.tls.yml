# Docker Compose configuration for TLS tests
# This setup runs the server with native TLS support enabled
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.tls.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit

services:
  server:
    environment:
      - GRPC_BIND_ADDRESS=[::]:50051
      - REST_BIND_ADDRESS=[::]:8080
      - TLS_CERT_PATH=/app/server.crt
      - TLS_KEY_PATH=/app/server.key
    volumes:
      # Mount self-signed certificates for testing
      - ./tls-certs:/app:ro
    healthcheck:
      # For TLS, we need to use openssl or grpcurl to check health
      # For simplicity, just check if the process is running
